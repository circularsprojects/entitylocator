# Entitylocator
Entitylocator is a simple mod designed to make it easier to find minecraft bases by analysing entity counts and the F3+shift pie chart.

You can find the latest development build in `Actions -> Latest workflow run -> Artifacts -> entitylocator-dev`
## Current features:
- Tests if entity count is above 100, and if so sends a message to the client.
- [Unfinished] Tests if certain blocks appear in the F3 pie chart, and if so sends a message to the client.
- [Unfinished] Configurable options
